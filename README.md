# MPMB Succubus/Incubus (Concubus) Species
This script adds a Succubus/Incubus (Concubus) species. This version has been fully updated to the 2024 species rules.

## Introduction:
This isn't my first homebrew species, nor does it entirely consist of my own ideas, but this is the first one I have ironed out into a (hopefully) viable version ready for public release.

I wanted to make a Life Cleric that was a succubus taken from the Lower Planes days after having been born and was subsequently raised in a Temple to the God of Life/New Beginnings (Lathander in this instance), so I went and found an existing species online and heavily modified it with input from several GMs to what can be seen in the attached file and in the linked Homebrewery page.
The design intent of this variant of the succubus/incubus is that this is supposed to be the baseline state of all succubi/incubi at birth (for those that can be brought into existence via reproduction), with the other abilities on the official 5E stat blocks being the result of training from other succubi/incubi and from life choices as they grow up. This design intent is supposed to be roughly in line with my interpretation of the Forgotten Realms lore of the Tanar'ri succubi/incubi. This design intent likely does not line up with other Settings' lore.

I have already used an earlier version of this species to play my desired Life Cleric succubus several times with several GMs and they haven't really had any issues so far. That is possibly due to the fact that I was playing a heavily armored Cleric & therefore couldn't fly around during combat, and because my character didn't like using the variant **Silver Tongue** Trait included below, even though she had it from Lvl 1.

This species has a score of 35 on the “Detect Balance” tool by Eleazzaar & a score of 8.75 on the Musicus Scale, with the following breakdown:

| Species Attribute       | Score |
|:-----------------------:|:-----:|
| 60' Telepathy           |   8   |
| Skill Prof (persuasion) |   2   |

# Species Information:
## General Description:
Succubi are the iconic depiction of lust. Feared for their typically evil nature and ability to steal one's soul, succubi are Fiends who wield subtle illusions and enchantments to tempt their victims into forfeiting their eternal souls. Succubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.<br>
Succubi/incubi of this very rare variant normally don’t live up to this reputation. These concubi were, by chance or by design, taken from the Lower Planes not long after birth, usually to the Material Plane. As a result of their upbringing away from other concubi, these succubi/incubi can be found living among mortals trying to make their own way in the world. Some are clerics for gods of life, others are rogues using what little of their abilities they have learned to cause mischief or mayhem. Regardless of their life path, most of them share two aspects of the succubus reputation; being flirtatious and ravenous for something. What a given concubus is ravenous for varies from one individual to another, but it is usually related to their life path. Most avoid fighting where possible, instead choosing seduction or fleeing.<br>
The gender-neutral term for succubi and incubi is "concubi".

## Physical Description:
Concubi in their true forms have an appearance similar to that of humans, but are horned, clawed, tailed, winged, and attractive. They are typically slender, well toned, and are very rarely overly muscular. Due to their shapechanging abilities, they can tweak their appearances or even change them completely to suit their needs.<br>
Like humans, these concubi created by sexual reproduction reach maturity around the age of 18 years. 

## Names:
Concubi tend to have names in the Abyssal or Infernal language, though most of this variant don’t know their original given name, instead going by the name given to them by the species and/or culture they were raised by.

## Traits:
***Fiendish Nature.*** Your creature type is considered to be Fiend. Additionally, you have Resistance to Fire damage, but Vulnerability to Radiant damage.

***Size.*** You can be either Small or Medium, but will be unable to change between the two after this choice has been made.

***Speed.*** Your base Speed is 30 feet (9m).

***Life Span.*** Because you are a Fiend, you are immortal unless killed on the Plane you were born in. If killed on a Plane other than the one you were born in, you return to your home Plane after 1d20 days.

***Telepathy.*** You have Telepathy out to a range of 60 feet (18m).

***Darkvision.*** Because you are a Fiend, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in Dim Light within 60 feet (18m) of you as if it were Bright Light, and in Darkness as if it were Dim Light. You can't discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray.

***Silver Tongue.*** You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill.

***Shapechanger.*** As an Action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. As a Bonus Action, you can transform a small part of your body, like your hands or horns for example. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die. <br>
You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species; you lose the Flying Speed granted by your ***Wings*** Trait if your current form does not have wings; otherwise, none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different Size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.

***Wings.*** You have a pair of wings that give you a Flying Speed of 30 feet (9m). You cannot use this Fly Speed if you are wearing Medium or Heavy Armor or if your current form granted by your ***Shapechanger*** Trait does not have wings.

***__Optional Trait Variant:__***
Including the following variant of the **Silver Tongue** Trait would make this species too powerful at Lvls 1-5, and as a result, it has been shunted into a variant that requires DM permission to use. Furthermore, though I the author suggests that the Charm effect come online at Character Levels 7-10 for balance purposes, the player should discuss with their DM when exactly the Charm effect of this Trait is granted to the player's character. Balance can also be maintained with the following logic: the earlier the Charm effect of this variant of the Silver Tongue Trait comes online, the less inclined the character should be to use it. This variant of the **Silver Tongue** Trait isn't coded into the script.

***Silver Tongue.*** You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill. Growing up you had moments where you were unusually persuasive for reasons you couldn't fathom, but you have since learned how to control this ability of yours. At a Character Level of the DM's choice, you gain an ability wherein if you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you say, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is magically charmed by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter.

**Known Bugs:**
- Will alter when one is found.
